## Codebase Patterns
- CLI entry is `packages/opencode/src/index.ts` — yargs middleware runs before any command
- Bootstrap phases are in `packages/opencode/src/project/bootstrap.ts` — already has `measure()` helper
- Instance creation flow: `Instance.provide()` → `Project.fromDirectory()` → `init()` (InstanceBootstrap)
- Config loading is in `Config.state()` (lazy per-Instance) with sub-phases: auth, remote-fetch, global, project, directory-scan
- Worker thread entry: `packages/opencode/src/cli/cmd/tui/worker.ts` — `Log.init()` is now synchronous, followed by `await Log.flush()`
- `Log.init()` is synchronous — buffers to in-memory array. Call `Log.flush()` after directories are ready to write buffer to disk
- TUI init: `packages/opencode/src/cli/cmd/tui/app.tsx` — `getTerminalBackgroundColor()` now uses COLORFGBG/cache/150ms timeout
- KV store file is at `~/.local/state/opencode/kv.json` — can be read directly outside SolidJS context via `Bun.file().json()`
- `packages/opencode/src/global/index.ts` — no module-level await; call `Global.ensureDirectories()` explicitly before `Log.flush()`
- Pre-existing 6 security test failures in `write-edit-bypass.test.ts`, `audit-log.test.ts`, `inheritance.test.ts`, `config.test.ts`, `mcp-policy.test.ts` — not related to cold-start work
- TUI thread (`thread.ts`) now starts TUI with RPC immediately; resolveNetworkOptions runs in background. HTTP server only started if CLI flags or config require it
- Remote wellknown config fetched with 3s timeout, cached to `Global.Path.cache/wellknown/` with 5-min TTL (stale-while-revalidate)
- Plugin loading (`plugin/index.ts`) uses `Promise.allSettled()` for both internal and external plugins; `BunProc.install()` has Lock serialization + 10s timeout
- `installDependencies()` runs in background after `Config.state()` returns — `Instance.dispose()` triggers config reload on completion
- `Auth.all()` and `global()` run in parallel at start of `Config.state()` — independent data sources
- `loadCommand/loadAgent/loadMode/loadPlugin` run via `Promise.all()` per directory — different glob patterns, independent subdirectories

## 2026-02-13 - US-001
- Implemented `--startup-trace` CLI flag with per-phase startup timing output to stderr in JSON format
- Created `packages/opencode/src/util/startup-trace.ts` — StartupTrace module with begin/end/measure/record/output functions supporting nested phases
- Instrumented phases: global-init, log-init, worker-spawn, terminal-bg-detect, resolve-network-options, project-detect, git-metadata, config-load (with sub-phases: remote-fetch, global-config, project-config, directory-scan), server-init, instance-bootstrap (with per-phase detail from existing bootstrap.ts measure)
- Files changed: startup-trace.ts (new), index.ts, bootstrap.ts, instance.ts, project.ts, config.ts, thread.ts, app.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The StartupTrace module uses a stack-based approach for nested phases — `begin()` pushes a new children array, `end()` pops and nests
  - `record()` is used for flat phase entries (e.g., bootstrap sub-phases that already have their own timing)
  - Config.state() closure requires `??` guards for `result.agent` and `!` for `result.plugin` because TypeScript can't narrow through closures
  - `--startup-trace` flag is checked via `process.argv.includes()` BEFORE yargs parses, so timing starts from first import
  - Output happens after `cli.parse()` completes — for TUI commands that block, trace won't output until TUI exits

## 2026-02-13 - US-002
- Optimized terminal background color detection from ~1000ms to ~0ms on subsequent launches
- Three-tier detection: COLORFGBG env var (instant) → KV cache (fast read) → OSC 11 query (150ms timeout)
- Cache stored in `terminal_bg_cache` key in `~/.local/state/opencode/kv.json`
- Exported `clearTerminalBgCache()` from app.tsx for manual re-detection
- Files changed: app.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - COLORFGBG format: "foreground;background" — last value is terminal color index 0-15
  - KV store is a SolidJS context (useKV) — can't use inside getTerminalBackgroundColor, must read file directly
  - `Bun.file().json()` is async — use it for cache reads since the function is already async
  - The KV file may not exist on first launch — handle gracefully with .catch()
---

## 2026-02-13 - US-003
- Made Log.init() synchronous — no longer awaits any IO operations
- Logs buffer to an in-memory array until Log.flush() is called
- Log.flush() writes buffered messages to disk and switches to direct file writer mode
- cleanup() is now fire-and-forget with .catch(() => {}) to prevent unhandled rejections
- fs.truncate() moved into flush() — no longer blocks init()
- When print: true, init() immediately switches to stderr writer (no buffering needed)
- Files changed: log.ts, index.ts, worker.ts, preload.ts, client.test.ts, e2e-local.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `Log.init()` with `print: true` doesn't need flush — writes directly to stderr
  - `Log.init()` with `print: false` buffers to array until `flush()` is called
  - Multiple `Log.init()` calls in test files (after preload) don't re-create writers — they just update level/logpath
  - `flushed` flag prevents double-flush and ensures buffer is only written once
  - The `write` variable is a function reference that gets swapped: buffer → file writer (or stderr)
  - US-005 (Global.ensureDirectories) will further optimize by decoupling directory creation from module-level await, allowing Log.init() + flush() to happen earlier

## 2026-02-13 - US-004
- Decoupled resolveNetworkOptions() from TUI rendering — TUI now starts immediately with RPC in the common case
- Split logic into two paths: CLI-explicit server flags (--port/--hostname/--mdns) block as before; common case starts TUI first, resolves config in background
- Background resolution checks if config says server is needed (mdns, non-default port/hostname) and starts HTTP server asynchronously
- TUI works fine over RPC regardless — HTTP server is only for external access
- Files changed: thread.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `SDKProvider` in `sdk.tsx` takes url/fetch/events as props at init time — can't easily change after mount
  - RPC path always works: `createWorkerFetch` → worker `rpc.fetch` → `Server.App().fetch(request)` in-process
  - HTTP server started via `client.call("server", networkOpts)` is additive — doesn't break RPC communication
  - `Config.global()` is the blocking call in `resolveNetworkOptions()` — it's a lazy() that reads config files
  - When CLI flags like `--port` are present, we still need to block to get the actual port value from config before starting the server
---

## 2026-02-13 - US-005
- Eliminated module-level blocking `await` from `global/index.ts`
- Moved directory creation (`fs.mkdir`) and cache version check into `Global.ensureDirectories()` async function
- `Global.Path.*` properties are now pure path computations — no IO on import
- Added `await Global.ensureDirectories()` calls before `await Log.flush()` in: CLI entry (`index.ts`), worker entry (`worker.ts`), test preload (`preload.ts`)
- Cache version check now uses `.catch(() => [])` instead of try/catch for readdir failure (follows codebase no-try-catch style)
- Files changed: global/index.ts, index.ts, worker.ts, preload.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Importing `Global` no longer triggers IO — safe to import anywhere without blocking
  - The initialization order is: `Log.init()` (sync, buffers) → `Global.ensureDirectories()` (creates dirs) → `Log.flush()` (writes buffer to disk)
  - `Global.Path.*` reads are always available immediately — they're just `path.join()` results
  - The cache version check clears the entire cache directory when version mismatches — includes `readdir` + `rm` for each item
  - Test preload uses dynamic `await import()` for both `Log` and `Global` to ensure env vars are set before xdg-basedir reads them
---

## 2026-02-13 - US-006
- Added timeout and graceful degradation for remote config fetching in `config.ts`
- `AbortSignal.timeout(3000)` on all wellknown fetch() calls — 3-second hard timeout
- On timeout/network error: degrade to empty config, log at warning level (no more crash on fetch failure)
- Cache to `Global.Path.cache/wellknown/{xxHash32}.json` with 5-minute TTL
- Stale-while-revalidate: expired cache used immediately, background async refresh
- Converted serial `for` loop to `Promise.allSettled()` — multiple wellknown entries fetched in parallel
- Type narrowing via filter type predicate for wellknown auth entries
- Files changed: config.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `Object.entries(auth).filter(fn)` doesn't narrow union types — need explicit type predicate `(entry): entry is [string, WellknownType]`
  - `Bun.hash.xxHash32()` returns a number — convert with `.toString(16)` for filename-safe hash
  - `AbortSignal.timeout(ms)` creates a signal that auto-aborts after timeout — cleaner than manual AbortController
  - Cache file format: `{ timestamp: number, data: any }` — timestamp used for TTL comparison
  - The `load()` function in config.ts does env var substitution and schema validation — must pass JSON string, not object
---

## 2026-02-13 - US-007
- Parallelized plugin loading in `Plugin.state()` — both internal and external plugins now load via `Promise.allSettled()`
- Internal plugins (CodexAuthPlugin, CopilotAuthPlugin) loaded in parallel
- External plugins: install + import + init all run in parallel per-plugin
- 10-second timeout on `BunProc.install()` via `Promise.race()` to prevent slow npm registry from blocking
- Single plugin failure logged as error but doesn't affect other plugins or startup
- Verified `PluginInput` is read-only (client, project, worktree, directory, serverUrl, $, hasBuiltIn) — safe to share
- Files changed: plugin/index.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `PluginInput` type is defined in `packages/plugin/src/index.ts` — all fields are read-only primitives/objects
  - `BunProc.install()` uses a `Lock.write("bun-install")` — parallel installs will serialize on the lock, which is correct behavior (prevents concurrent bun add)
  - External plugins that return empty string from install (builtin failure) return `[]` hooks — handled by spreading into hooks array
  - `Promise.allSettled()` ensures one plugin timeout/failure doesn't reject the entire batch
  - `Promise.race()` with `setTimeout` for timeout doesn't cancel the underlying install — the lock may still be held. This is acceptable since the timeout only affects the caller
---

## 2026-02-13 - US-008
- Deferred `installDependencies()` out of `Config.state()` critical path — config now returns immediately
- Directories needing install are collected during scan, then installed in background via `Promise.all()`
- On background install completion, `Instance.dispose()` triggers config reload to pick up newly installed plugins
- Added 30-second per-directory timeout via `Promise.race()` to prevent slow npm registry from blocking
- `needsInstall()` check (Option B) already exists — checks `node_modules/@opencode-ai/plugin` existence and version match
- Files changed: config.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `Instance.dispose()` resets lazy state — next `Config.state()` call re-runs the full config loading pipeline
  - Background `Promise.all()` with `Promise.race()` timeout pattern: timeout rejects the race but doesn't cancel the underlying install (bun process continues)
  - The directory scan loop still runs `needsInstall()` synchronously (fast check: `existsSync` + `Bun.file().json()`) — only the actual `installDependencies()` is deferred
  - Plugin/command/agent loading from directories proceeds regardless of install status — existing `node_modules` content is used if available
---

## 2026-02-13 - US-009
- Parallelized three independent operations in `Config.state()`:
  1. `Auth.all()` and `global()` now run via `Promise.all()` — auth reads its own file, global reads config files, no dependency
  2. `Filesystem.findUp("opencode.jsonc")` and `Filesystem.findUp("opencode.json")` run in parallel for project config discovery
  3. `loadCommand()`, `loadAgent()`, `loadMode()`, `loadPlugin()` run via `Promise.all()` per directory — they use different glob patterns on independent subdirectories
- Config precedence order preserved: remote → global → custom → project → directory → inline → managed
- Files changed: config.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `Auth.all()` reads `~/.config/opencode/auth.json` — completely independent of `global()` which reads config files
  - The `global()` result must be merged AFTER remote-fetch results to preserve precedence order (global overrides remote)
  - `Filesystem.findUp` returns files ordered nearest-first — `toReversed()` makes farthest-first for correct low→high merge
  - Original merge order for project config: all jsonc (farthest first), then all json (farthest first) — json at project dir level has highest precedence
