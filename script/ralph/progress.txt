# Ralph Progress Log
# Feature: Security Access Control
# Branch: ralph/security-access-control
# Started:
# ============================================

## Codebase Patterns
- Use namespace pattern for modules (e.g., `export namespace SecuritySchema { ... }`)
- Use Zod for schema validation with `z` import from "zod"
- Export both the Zod schema and inferred type (e.g., `export const Foo = z.object({...})` and `export type Foo = z.infer<typeof Foo>`)
- Follow code style: no try/catch (use .catch()), no any types, no else statements, prefer const
- Run typecheck with `~/.bun/bin/bun run tsc --noEmit` in packages/opencode directory
- Use minimatch (already available) for glob pattern matching
- Use Log.create({ service: "service-name" }) for logging within namespaces

## 2026-02-04 - US-001
- What was implemented: Created security configuration Zod schema for `.opencode-security.json`
- Files changed:
  - packages/opencode/src/security/schema.ts (created)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The codebase uses namespace pattern extensively (see config/config.ts for examples)
  - Zod schemas should export both the validator and the inferred type
  - bun is required but may not be in PATH - use `~/.bun/bin/bun` directly
  - turbo typecheck may fail due to binary path issues; use `bun run tsc --noEmit` directly in package directory
  - Use minimatch (already in package.json) for glob pattern matching
---

## 2026-02-04 - US-002
- What was implemented: Created configuration loader for `.opencode-security.json`
- Files changed:
  - packages/opencode/src/security/config.ts (created)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use Bun.file() API for file operations
  - Follow fail-open pattern for security config loading (log warning, return empty config)
  - Use Log.create({ service: "service-name" }) for logging
---

## 2026-02-04 - US-003
- What was implemented: Created path-based access checker with glob pattern matching and role hierarchy
- Files changed:
  - packages/opencode/src/security/access.ts (created)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - minimatch from package.json provides glob pattern matching
  - Role hierarchy: higher level numbers = more access (admin > developer > viewer)
  - Access checker returns `{ allowed: boolean, reason?: string }` for clear error messages
  - For directory rules, need to handle both the directory itself and files within it
---

## 2026-02-04 - US-004
- What was implemented: Added rule inheritance for subdirectories to security access checker
- Files changed:
  - packages/opencode/src/security/access.ts (modified)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Rule inheritance works by walking up parent directories and checking for matching directory rules
  - getInheritanceChain() returns both direct matches and inherited rules with metadata
  - The inheritance model is additive: parent restrictions cannot be removed by child rules
  - The InheritedRule interface tracks matchType ("direct" | "inherited") and inheritedFrom path
  - Path operations should normalize slashes with .replace(/\\/g, "/") for cross-platform support
---

## 2026-02-04 - US-005
- What was implemented: Added symbolic link resolution to access checker
- Files changed:
  - packages/opencode/src/security/access.ts (modified)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use fs.lstatSync with { throwIfNoEntry: false } to check if a file exists without throwing
  - fs.realpathSync resolves the entire symlink chain automatically
  - When checking symlinks, check both the symlink path and its target path for security
  - Add "(symlink target is protected)" to denial messages for clarity
  - Export resolveSymlink() function for potential reuse in other security modules
---

## 2026-02-04 - US-006
- What was implemented: Created marker-based segment detector for protected code segments
- Files changed:
  - packages/opencode/src/security/segments.ts (created)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The findMarkerSegments function uses a stack-based approach to handle nested markers correctly
  - Common comment styles supported: // (JS/TS/C/C++/Java), # (Python/Ruby/Shell), <!-- --> (HTML/XML), /* */ (C/JS), """ and ''' (Python docstrings)
  - Regex special characters in marker text are properly escaped with escapeRegExp()
  - Segments are sorted by start position for consistent output
  - The MarkerSegment interface has { start: number, end: number, rule: MarkerConfig }
---

## 2026-02-04 - US-007
- What was implemented: Added AST-based segment detector for TypeScript/JavaScript using TypeScript compiler API
- Files changed:
  - packages/opencode/src/security/segments.ts (modified)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - TypeScript is available as a devDependency in the project
  - Use `import ts from "typescript"` to access the TypeScript compiler API
  - ts.createSourceFile() parses source code into an AST; it doesn't throw on syntax errors
  - The findASTSegments function detects: function declarations, arrow functions (variable declarations), class declarations, and class methods (including arrow function properties)
  - Node types mapped to rule nodeTypes: "function", "arrow_function", "class", "method"
  - Use ts.forEachChild for AST traversal and node.getStart(sourceFile)/node.getEnd() for positions
  - Language detection uses file extension; supports ts, tsx, js, jsx, mjs, cjs
  - The ASTSegment interface has { start: number, end: number, rule: ASTConfig, nodeType: string }
---

## 2026-02-04 - US-008
- What was implemented: Created content redaction utility for replacing protected segments with placeholder text
- Files changed:
  - packages/opencode/src/security/redact.ts (created)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The redactContent function accepts any segment type with start/end properties (MarkerSegment, ASTSegment, or generic Segment)
  - Overlapping segments must be merged before redacting to avoid double-processing
  - Line numbers are preserved by counting newlines in the original text and adding the same number after the placeholder
  - Processing segments from end to start preserves character indices during replacement
  - The REDACTED_PLACEHOLDER constant is "[REDACTED: Security Protected]"
  - The SecurityRedact namespace exports: Segment interface, REDACTED_PLACEHOLDER constant, mergeSegments(), and redactContent()
---

## 2026-02-04 - US-009
- What was implemented: Integrated security access control with the Read tool
- Files changed:
  - packages/opencode/src/tool/read.ts (modified)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Tool files are in packages/opencode/src/tool/ directory, each tool has its own file (read.ts, write.ts, edit.ts, etc.)
  - Tools use Tool.define() pattern with description, parameters (Zod schema), and execute function
  - Security check should happen after file existence check and before reading content
  - For segment-level protection, read the file first, then find protected segments and apply redaction
  - Role detection is a placeholder (getDefaultRole) until US-027 implements proper token-based role detection
  - Helper functions getRoleLevel() and isRoleAllowed() are duplicated from access.ts - consider moving to a shared utility in future
  - Use Log.create({ service: "security-read" }) for tool-specific security logging
---

## 2026-02-04 - US-010
- What was implemented: Integrated security access control with the Write tool
- Files changed:
  - packages/opencode/src/tool/write.ts (modified)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Write tool follows the same pattern as Read tool for security integration
  - Security check should happen early in execute(), after path resolution and before file operations
  - The getDefaultRole() helper function is duplicated from read.ts - this pattern is repeated across tools until US-027 implements centralized role detection
  - Write tool only needs file-level protection (no segment-level check needed for write operations)
  - Import SecurityAccess, SecurityConfig, SecuritySchema, and Log from their respective modules
  - Use securityLog.debug() to log security check results for debugging
---

## 2026-02-04 - US-011
- What was implemented: Integrated security access control with the Edit tool, including both file-level and segment-level protection
- Files changed:
  - packages/opencode/src/tool/edit.ts (modified)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Edit tool requires both file-level and segment-level protection checks (unlike Write which only needs file-level)
  - Segment-level check must happen AFTER reading file content but BEFORE calling replace()
  - Use findEditRange() to locate where the edit will occur using the same replacer logic as replace()
  - Check for overlap between edit range and protected segments using simple interval overlap logic
  - The edit tool uses multiple "replacer" functions to find matches (SimpleReplacer, LineTrimmedReplacer, etc.)
  - Protected segments check for "write" operation (not "read") in deniedOperations
  - Error messages should include the protected segment positions to help users understand what's protected
  - Security log uses "security-edit" service name for tool-specific logging
---

## 2026-02-04 - US-012
- What was implemented: Integrated security access control with the Glob tool to filter out protected files from results
- Files changed:
  - packages/opencode/src/tool/glob.ts (modified)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Glob tool filters files AFTER collecting results but BEFORE returning them
  - Use `SecurityAccess.checkAccess(path, "read", currentRole).allowed` to filter files
  - Log only the count of filtered files, not the paths (for security)
  - The same getDefaultRole() pattern is used as in other tools (read.ts, write.ts, edit.ts)
  - Security log service name follows pattern: "security-glob"
  - The metadata.count should reflect the filtered count (allowedFiles.length), not the original count
