Run the test suite and analyze results. If tests fail, investigate and fix the failures.

Strategy:
1. Run the relevant test command for this project
2. If tests pass, report success with a summary
3. If tests fail, analyze the failure output to understand root cause
4. Fix test failures (distinguish between broken tests vs broken code)
5. Re-run tests to confirm fixes
