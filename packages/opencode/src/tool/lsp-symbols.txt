Search for code symbols (functions, classes, variables, etc.) using Language Server Protocol (LSP).

Supports two scopes:
- document: Get all symbols in a specific file
- workspace: Search for symbols across the entire workspace by name

Parameters:
- filePath: The file to search in (required for document scope, used for server selection in workspace scope)
- scope: Either 'document' (file symbols) or 'workspace' (cross-project search)
- query: Search query for workspace scope (filters symbol names). Ignored for document scope
- limit: Maximum number of results to return (default 50)

Returns symbol names, kinds, and locations. If no LSP server is available, an error is returned.
