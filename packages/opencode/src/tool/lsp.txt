Interact with Language Server Protocol (LSP) servers to get code intelligence features.

Supported operations:
- goToDefinition: Find where a symbol is defined
- findReferences: Find all references to a symbol
- hover: Get hover information (documentation, type info) for a symbol
- documentSymbol: Get all symbols (functions, classes, variables) in a document
- workspaceSymbol: Search for symbols across the entire workspace
- goToImplementation: Find implementations of an interface or abstract method
- prepareCallHierarchy: Get call hierarchy item at a position (functions/methods)
- incomingCalls: Find all functions/methods that call the function at a position
- outgoingCalls: Find all functions/methods called by the function at a position
- diagnostics: Get diagnostics (errors, warnings) for a file. Optional severity filter.
- prepareRename: Check if a symbol at a position can be renamed
- rename: Rename a symbol across the workspace. Requires newName parameter.

All operations require:
- filePath: The file to operate on

Most operations also require:
- line: The line number (1-based, as shown in editors)
- character: The character offset (1-based, as shown in editors)

The diagnostics operation does not require line/character. The rename operation additionally requires newName.

Note: LSP servers must be configured for the file type. If no server is available, an error will be returned.
