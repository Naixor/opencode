Given a file path and position (line + character), returns documentation, type information, and other hover details for the symbol at that position. Useful for understanding types, reading docstrings, and checking function signatures.

Parameters:
- filePath: The absolute or relative path to the file
- line: The line number (1-based, as shown in editors)
- character: The character offset (1-based, as shown in editors)

Returns hover content (documentation, type info) for the symbol. If no LSP server is available, an error is returned.
