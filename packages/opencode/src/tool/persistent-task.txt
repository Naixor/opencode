Manage persistent tasks that survive across sessions. Tasks are stored as JSON files in .opencode/tasks/.

Operations:
- create: Create a new task with subject, description, owner, dependencies
- get: Retrieve a task by ID
- list: List all tasks, optionally filtered by status or ready state
- update: Update task fields including status transitions
- delete: Remove a task

Task IDs use T-{uuid} format. Status transitions: pending -> in_progress -> completed/failed/cancelled.

Dependencies: Use blockedBy to specify task IDs that must complete before this task is ready. Use the ready filter to find tasks with all dependencies satisfied.
