Find all references to a symbol using Language Server Protocol (LSP).

Given a file path and position (line + character), returns all locations where the symbol at that position is referenced across the codebase.

Parameters:
- filePath: The absolute or relative path to the file
- line: The line number (1-based, as shown in editors)
- character: The character offset (1-based, as shown in editors)
- includeDeclaration: Whether to include the declaration itself in results (default true)
- limit: Maximum number of results to return (default 100)

Returns file:line:col locations of all references. Results are limited to prevent overwhelming output. If no LSP server is available, an error is returned.
