Delegate a task to a specialized agent with optional category-based model routing and background execution.

The delegate_task tool launches a sub-agent to handle a task. You can run tasks synchronously (waiting for completion) or asynchronously in the background.

Available agent types:
{agents}

Task Categories (for model routing):
{categories}

Parameters:
- description: A short (3-5 words) description of the task
- prompt: The detailed task for the agent to perform
- run_in_background: If true, returns task_id immediately without waiting. Use background_output to check status later
- category: Optional task category for model routing (e.g., 'quick', 'deep', 'ultrabrain'). Cannot be used with subagent_type
- subagent_type: Optional agent type to use. Cannot be used with category
- session_id: Optional existing session to continue
- load_skills: Optional array of skill names to inject into sub-agent context

Usage notes:
- Use run_in_background=true for long-running tasks that don't block your workflow
- Categories route to appropriate models (e.g., 'quick' uses fast/cheap models)
- Specify subagent_type for a specific agent, or category for automatic model selection
- Sub-agents cannot call delegate_task (prevents recursion)
- Use load_skills to give the sub-agent access to specific skill content
