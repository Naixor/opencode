Rename a symbol across all files using LSP.

Renames the symbol at the given position to the new name. Returns all affected files and the changes that would be made. Changes are NOT automatically applied — review the output and use edit tools to apply.

Parameters:
- filePath: The file containing the symbol
- line: Line number (1-based)
- character: Character offset (1-based)
- newName: The new name for the symbol

Note: Use lsp_prepare_rename first to verify the symbol can be renamed. LSP servers must be configured for the file type.
