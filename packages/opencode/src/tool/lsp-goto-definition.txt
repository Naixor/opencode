Find where a symbol is defined using Language Server Protocol (LSP).

Given a file path and position (line + character), returns the location(s) where the symbol at that position is defined. Useful for navigating to function definitions, class declarations, variable assignments, etc.

Parameters:
- filePath: The absolute or relative path to the file
- line: The line number (1-based, as shown in editors)
- character: The character offset (1-based, as shown in editors)

Returns file:line:col locations of the definition(s). If no LSP server is available for the file type, an error is returned.
