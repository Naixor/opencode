Find implementations of an interface or abstract method using Language Server Protocol (LSP).

Given a file path and position (line + character), returns the location(s) where the interface or abstract method at that position is implemented. Useful for navigating from interfaces to concrete implementations.

Parameters:
- filePath: The absolute or relative path to the file
- line: The line number (1-based, as shown in editors)
- character: The character offset (1-based, as shown in editors)

Returns file:line:col locations of all implementations. If no LSP server is available, an error is returned.
