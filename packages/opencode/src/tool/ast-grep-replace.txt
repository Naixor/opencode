- AST-aware code refactoring tool that searches and replaces structural patterns
- Uses ast-grep to match and transform code at the syntax tree level
- Pattern syntax uses `$VAR` for wildcards in both pattern and rewrite
- Example: pattern `console.log($MSG)` with rewrite `logger.info($MSG)` transforms all console.log calls
- Supports 25 programming languages
- Default mode is dry run (shows changes without applying them)
- Set dryRun=false to apply changes to files on disk
- Respects security access controls: will not modify protected files or code segments
- Requires @ast-grep/napi package to be installed
