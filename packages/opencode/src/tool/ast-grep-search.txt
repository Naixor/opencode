- AST-aware code search tool that finds structural patterns in source code
- Uses ast-grep to match code patterns at the syntax tree level, not just text
- More precise than regex: understands code structure (functions, classes, expressions)
- Pattern syntax uses `$VAR` for wildcards (e.g., `console.log($MSG)` matches any console.log call)
- Supports 25 programming languages
- Use this when you need structural code matching that regex cannot provide
- Results include file path, line number, matched code, and surrounding context
- Requires @ast-grep/napi package to be installed
